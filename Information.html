            <h1>Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra Described in Minecraft</h1>

        </header>
        Hello, for those majoring in computer science, I have found a fun way to describe logic gates and boolean algebra using Minecraft redstone.
        <!-- each of them will have a picture, maybe this will be a table?-->
            AND
            OR
            NOT
            XOR
            NAND
            NOR
            X-NOR
